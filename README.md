# Omni
This is a Personal AI Assistant that utilizes the flexibility of open-source Ollama models.

## Features

- AI assistant powered by Ollama models
- Streaming support
- Frontend integration with easy-to-use HTML templates (index.html and load-tester.html)

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- Ollama (used for AI model serving)
- Node.js (for running the backend)
- Bun (for building and running the project)

## Installation
Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdjamilkashemporosh/omni.git
```
> Before running the project, both the `backend` and `frontend` need to be configured.

### Backend
#### 1. Install Dependencies
   
Navigate to the `backend` folder and run: 
```bash
bun install 
```
#### 2. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file under the `backeend` directory and add the following properties:
```bash
BASE_URL= # Ollama URL (e.g., http://localhost:1134)
MODEL= # Model name (e.g., phi4)
PORT= # Port number (e.g., 8000)
```
#### 3. Running the Backend
To run the backend in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
To build the backend:
```bash
npm run build
```
To run the backend in production mode (ensure to build first):
```bash
npm run start
```

### Frontend

In your frontend code, you need to update the API URL to match your backend configuration. Navigate to the frontend folder and open the config/config.js file. Then, update the following line accordingly:

```js
export const API_URL = '';  // (e.g., http://localhost:8000/chat)
```

# ðŸš€  Once your backend is running and the frontend is set up, open the HTML file in your browser to interact with the application. ðŸš€
